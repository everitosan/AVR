#AVR Projects

This repository contains several exmaples developed for the **ATMEGA8** and **ATMEGA48** for learning porpuse.

Every exmaple is located under a new brach, so you can follow them in a easier way.

The examples were developed in MacOS with the [CrossPack for AVRÂ® Development](https://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html) and a USBasp programmer.
